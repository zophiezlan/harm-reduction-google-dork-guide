# Ideas for Dork Enhancement

**1. Add Top/Suggested Keywords in Keywords Block:**

    - Add keywords for smart filtering such as "Peer" and "X" and build them into the dork builder interface in the keywords block.

**2. Fix Theme Colour-Selector and Dark/Light Switcher:** - Ensure the theme colour-selector is
present in the menu with the dark/light switcher and that both the toggle and selectors are
functional.

**3. Add instant dork to docs cards:**

    - Add an "Instant Dork" button to dork code blocks in the docs next to the copy button that searches the dork immediately when clicked.
    - Use this to replace the generated "👉 Run" link for each dork (which is currently poorly implemented). I guess the "👉 Run" making script can also be removed.

**4. Create a DorkScript Syntax Highlighting Solution:**

    - Create a syntax highlighting solution for DorkScript that can be used across the site, including in code blocks in the docs and in the dork builder interface.
    - This could be a custom solution or an extension of an existing syntax highlighter like Prism.js or Highlight.js.
    - Implement linting and error highlighting for DorkScript in the dork builder interface to help users identify and fix syntax errors as they write their dorks.

**5. Remove Unused Theme Toggle in Navbar:**

    - Remove the unused theme toggle in the navbar menu since the theme selector and dark/light switcher has been moved to its own place on the navbar.
    - This leaves just the github link in the navbar menu, perhaps we can add more useful links and features here in the future.
    - The separate theme selector and dark/light switcher menu can be expanded and moved to the underside of the left sidebar on desktop view for better accessibility. It can remain collapsed in the navbar on mobile view for space efficiency.

**6. Improve Dork Builder Interface:**

    - Move the blocks from 'tricks' to the main dork builder interface to make them more accessible.
    - Improve the usability and design of the dork builder interface to make it easier for users to create and customize their dorks.
