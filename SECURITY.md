# Security & Responsible Use Guidelines

This document outlines ethical guidelines for using dorks (advanced search operators) in harm
reduction work. These are not just suggestions—they are foundational principles that protect
individuals, communities, and the integrity of harm reduction practice.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Do No Harm

The fundamental principle of harm reduction applies to information searching:

- **Never search for identifiable individuals** in connection with drug use, overdose, or health
  status
- **Never seek leaked or exposed personal data** - if found accidentally, stop immediately
- **Prefer de-identified, aggregated sources** - public health data, not personal stories without
  consent
- **Consider downstream impacts** - how could this information be misused?

### 2. Public Interest, Not Personal Interest

Dorking should serve legitimate harm reduction purposes:

| Appropriate Uses                 | Inappropriate Uses                          |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Accessing research and evidence  | Finding leaked medical records              |
| Discovering workforce resources  | Circumventing access controls               |
| Finding government health alerts | Searching for individuals' drug use history |
| Locating service directories     | Harvesting personal contact information     |
| Monitoring policy developments   | Exposing private communications             |

### 3. Respect Privacy Boundaries

Even public information has privacy implications:

- **Forum posts** - People sharing in support communities deserve privacy
- **Historical records** - Past statements may not reflect current views
- **Aggregated data** - Small populations can make individuals identifiable
- **Metadata** - Document authors, edit histories may reveal more than intended

## Ethical Search Framework

Before running a search, ask yourself:

```txt
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. PURPOSE: Does this serve legitimate harm reduction?     │
│  2. NECESSITY: Is this search needed, or is there a        │
│     better source?                                          │
│  3. PROPORTIONALITY: Am I using the least invasive         │
│     approach?                                               │
│  4. HARM: Could this information harm anyone if found      │
│     or shared?                                              │
│  5. CONSENT: Would the subjects of this data expect it     │
│     to be found this way?                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> [!CAUTION] If you answer "no" to questions 1-3 or "yes" to questions 4-5, reconsider your search.

## What to Do If You Find Sensitive Data

### Accidentally Found Personal Information

1. **Stop immediately** - Do not save, share, or further investigate
2. **Clear your browser history** for that search
3. **Do not share** the query or findings with others
4. **Consider reporting** to your organization's privacy officer if appropriate

### Found a Data Breach or Exposed Database

1. **Do not access** the data beyond confirming it exists
2. **Document minimally** - Note the URL and general nature only
3. **Report responsibly**:
   - Contact the data owner if identifiable
   - Report to [ACSC](https://www.cyber.gov.au/report) (Australia) or equivalent
   - Consider
     [responsible disclosure](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/governance-and-user-education/governance/vulnerability-disclosure)
     pathways
4. **Do not publicize** until the issue is resolved

## Organizational Considerations

### Before Using These Techniques

- Review your organization's **privacy policies** and **data handling procedures**
- Ensure you have **appropriate authorization** for research activities
- Consider **ethics approval** for formal research projects
- Understand your **mandatory reporting obligations**

### Documentation & Governance

- **Log your searches** if conducting formal research
- **Cite sources** appropriately in any outputs
- **Verify currency** of any clinical or policy information
- **Maintain audit trails** for accountability

---

## Legal Considerations

### What's Generally Acceptable

- Searching for **publicly published** government documents
- Finding **official** health alerts and advisories
- Accessing **open access** research and grey literature
- Locating **publicly listed** service directories

### What May Be Problematic

- Circumventing **access controls** or paywalls
- Accessing **restricted** or password-protected content
- Using searches to **harass or stalk** individuals
- **Republishing** copyrighted material without permission

> [!WARNING] This is general guidance, not legal advice. Laws vary by jurisdiction. When in doubt,
> consult your organization's legal or compliance team.

## Protecting Yourself

### Browser Hygiene

- Use **private/incognito mode** for sensitive searches
- Consider a **research-specific browser profile**
- **Clear search history** regularly
- Be aware of **autocomplete** suggestions when demonstrating searches

### Professional Boundaries

- **Separate research from personal browsing**
- **Don't search** for clients, colleagues, or personal acquaintances
- **Document your purpose** when conducting research
- **Debrief** if you encounter distressing content

### Digital Security

- Use **strong, unique passwords** for research accounts
- Enable **two-factor authentication**
- Be cautious of **phishing** attempts when following search results
- Keep **software updated** to protect against vulnerabilities

we find and use information._
