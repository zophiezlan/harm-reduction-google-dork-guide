## 💡 Tips

### Tip 1: Create Multiple Engines

Create separate search engines for different purposes:

- General harm reduction
- Research only
- Policy/government
- Peer resources

### Tip 2: Share with Your Team

Once created, share the search URL with colleagues who may not be familiar with dorking.

### Tip 3: Embed on Intranet

If your organisation has an intranet, embed the search box for easy access.
