## 👥 Peer Knowledge is Expert Knowledge

This workflow is designed for **peer workers and people with lived experience**. It prioritises:

- Peer-led research and resources
- Lived experience voices
- "Nothing About Us Without Us" principles
- Resources that respect peer expertise

## 🎯 The Four-Step Peer-Centered Approach

### Step 1: Check Peer Organisations First

Always start with peer and drug user organisations.

```txt
site:nuaa.org.au OR site:aivl.org.au OR site:hrvic.org.au OR site:quihn.org [YOUR TOPIC] filetype:pdf
```

**Why:** Peer organisations hold knowledge that isn't in academic databases. Start here.

### Step 2: Look for Peer-Led Research

Search for research that was conducted **with** communities, not just **on** them.

```txt
[YOUR TOPIC] ("peer-led" OR "participatory" OR "co-designed") research filetype:pdf
```

**Why:** Participatory research centers lived experience in the research process.

### Step 3: Find Lived Experience Representation

Ensure the voices of people with lived experience are included.

```txt
[YOUR TOPIC] ("lived experience" OR "peer perspective" OR "user voice") filetype:pdf
```

**Why:** Documents that include peer perspectives are more relevant and respectful.

### Step 4: Apply "Nothing About Us Without Us" Filter

Before using any resource, ask:

- Were people with lived experience involved in design and delivery?
- Are peer voices quoted and centered?
- Does this respect the expertise of people who use drugs?

---

## 🚩 Red Flags in Search Results

Watch out for documents that:

- Talk **about** people who use drugs without peer authorship
- Research done **on** communities without **with** communities
- Policy developed **for** peers without peer input
- Use stigmatising language without critique
- Don't acknowledge peer expertise

---

## ✅ Green Flags in Search Results

Look for documents that:

- Are authored or co-authored by peer organisations
- Use people-first language throughout
- Include peer quotes and perspectives
- Acknowledge limitations of non-peer perspectives
- Reference peer-led work and organisations

## 🔍 Topic-Specific Peer Searches

### Replace [TOPIC] with Your Search Term

**Peer Organisation Resources:**

```txt
(site:nuaa.org.au OR site:aivl.org.au OR site:hrvic.org.au) [TOPIC] filetype:pdf
```

**Peer-Led Work:**

```txt
[TOPIC] "peer-led" OR "user-led" Australia filetype:pdf
```

**Lived Experience Perspectives:**

```txt
[TOPIC] "lived experience" OR "peer perspective" filetype:pdf
```

**Co-Design & Participation:**

```txt
[TOPIC] "co-design" OR "co-production" "people who use drugs" filetype:pdf
```

## 💡 Tips for Peer-Centered Searching

### Tip 1: Peer First, Academic Second

Start with peer organisations, then look at academic research. Often the best knowledge isn't in
journals.

### Tip 2: Check Authorship

When reading research, check: Were peers involved as researchers, not just subjects?

### Tip 3: Use Peer Language

Search using terms peers actually use, not just clinical terminology.

### Tip 4: Share Peer Resources

When you find good peer resources, share them with clinical and research colleagues who may not know
where to find them.

### Tip 5: Build Peer Archives

Save important peer publications—they sometimes disappear from websites.
