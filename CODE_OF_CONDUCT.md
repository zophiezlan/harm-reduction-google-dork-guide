# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Harm Reduction Google Dork Guide is a community resource built on harm reduction principles. We
are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and supportive environment for all contributors,
regardless of their background, identity, or experience with drug use.

## Harm Reduction Values

This project is grounded in core harm reduction principles:

### 1. Respect for People Who Use Drugs

- People who use drugs are the experts on their own lives
- Lived experience is valued knowledge
- We use non-stigmatizing, person-first language
- We reject moral judgments about drug use

### 2. Meeting People Where They Are

- We support people at all stages of their journey
- We don't require abstinence as a condition of participation
- We recognize that harm reduction works on a spectrum

### 3. Nothing About Us Without Us

- People with lived experience lead and inform this work
- Peer voices are centered, not tokenized
- We actively seek input from affected communities

### 4. Evidence-Based & Pragmatic

- We prioritize what works, not ideology
- We value public health over criminalization
- We support policy based on evidence, not stigma

## Language Matters

We use language that respects the dignity of people who use drugs:

| :--------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Person who uses drugs              | Addict, junkie, user |
| Substance use                      | Substance abuse      |
| Positive/negative (test results)   | Clean/dirty          |
| In recovery, not currently using   | Clean                |
| Overdose, poisoning                | OD'd (casually)      |
| Medication for opioid use disorder | Replacement therapy  |

> [!NOTE] When researching historical documents, you may need to use older terminology in search
> queries. This is acceptable for research purposes—context matters.
