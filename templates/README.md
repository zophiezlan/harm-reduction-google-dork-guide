## Tips for Using Templates

> [!TIP] Copy templates into your own document management system (Google Docs, Notion, SharePoint,
> etc.) rather than editing the originals.

### Best Practices

1. **Be consistent** - Use the same confidence ratings and categories across your team
2. **Save your dorks** - Document queries that worked well for future use
3. **Note the gaps** - What you couldn't find is as important as what you found
4. **Date everything** - Currency is critical in harm reduction
